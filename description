Business Problem: Forecast weekly store sales to improve inventory planning, promotions, and customer satisfaction.

Data Work: Cleaned and merged 3 datasets (store info, historical sales, economic factors). Handled missing values with imputation and created lag + moving average features.

EDA Insights: Holiday weeks had significantly higher sales, and store type “A” consistently outperformed others.

Modeling:

Baseline (Naive Forecast): RMSE ≈ 3940

Random Forest: RMSE ≈ 3869 (improvement over baseline)

Interpretation: Lagged sales were the most important predictors, followed by store size, holidays, and economic indicators.

Visuals:
📊 Sales trends over time
📊 Holiday vs Non-Holiday comparison
📊 Feature importance (Random Forest)
📊 Actual vs Predicted plots

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL (DuckDB), Matplotlib, Seaborn
